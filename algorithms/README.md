## Baking a Cake​🍰

**Big O Notation:**  Group algorithms by their speed⏱

* Getting ingredients from the fridge = seconds
* Baking the cake = minutes
* Frosting the cake = minutes

**Brute Force Algorithm:** Try everything🦍

* I don't remember grandma's recipe so i'll try
  * Every recipe on the internet 

**Greedy Algorithm:** Chooses the best local option🤑

* I don't remember grandma's recipe so i'll try
  * The first recipe on google

**Divide & Conquer** **Algorithms:** Convert big problems into small problems➗ ⚔ 

* Making Grandma's Cake
  1. Call Grandma for the recipe
  2. Mom will bring the ingredients
  3. Wifey will bake the cake
  4. I will eat the cake

**Sorting Algorithms:** Create order🌈

* Sort Grandma's recipe book by category: desserts, dinners, & appetizers 

**Search Algorithms:** Finds something‌🧐

* Look for Grandma's cake recipe in Grandma's recipe book

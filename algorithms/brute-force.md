## What's your pin number? 💳 🛍 🛒 

A **Brute Force** algorithm tries every possible combination to guess a correct pin number

```text
Brute Force a Pin Number
Assumptions: 
  Pin = Numbers = #
  Pin = 4 Digits = ____

Start with 0000
Add 1 & Try Pin 
Repeat 

10,000 possible pin numbers
```

🔨In Computer Science a **Brute Force** solution is normally not the best solution but is a good starting point to get a deeper understanding of the problem.🔨

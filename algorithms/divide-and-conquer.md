## Building a House 🏡

👷 A **Divide & Conquer** Algorithm divides building a house into smaller subproblems. 👷♀ 

1. Design
2. Foundation
3. Framing
4. Plumbing, Electrical, HVAC
5. Insulate
6. Drywall
7. Flooring & Countertops

1. Architect
2. Contractor
3. Carpenter
4. Plumbers
5. Electricians
6. Roofers
7. General Laborer

🕵♀**Divide & Conquer** is one of the most useful and common problem solving skills🕵♀

# Greedy

## What is a Greedy Algorithm? ðŸ¤‘ 

A **Greedy** Algorithm always takes the best possible option available.

##  Wall Street Trading Algorithm ðŸ’¸ 

ðŸ¤–**Lets Create A Wall Street Trading Bot**ðŸ¤– 

* Unicorn.com Inc ðŸ¦„ 
* Insider Trading InformationðŸ•µâ™‚ 
  * Known Future Stock Prices Next 5 Days 
  * $11, $8, $18, $4, $12
* Unicorn.com Trading Algorithm ðŸ¤– 
  * Buy Today 
    * if the Price Increases Tomorrow
  * Sell Today 
    * if the Price Decreases Tomorrow
* Sample Trading ðŸ•“ 
  * Next 5 Days = $11, $8, $18, $4, $12
* Transaction Logs of BotðŸ¤– 
  * $11 = Nothing
  * $08 = Buys 
  * $18 = Sells 
  * $04 = Buys
  * $12 = Sells
  * Profit = 18-8 + 12-4 = $16

ðŸ¦ŠThis strategy is the best possible option for this problem but can break down on different types of problemsðŸ¦Š 

## Good, Bad, & The Ugly ðŸ¤  

\*\*\*\*ðŸ•¹**Lets Make a Super Mario Bros Algorithm**ðŸ•¹\*\*\*\*

The **Greedy** algorithm is trying to beat the Super Mario game as fast as possible. Algorithm Rules: Mario always runs forward, jumps on enemies & jumps over obstacles. The greedy part of the algorithm is always "greedily" moving forward, this was chosen because it seems to be the fastest way to complete the level.

* GoodðŸ‘¾ 
  * Simple strategy, easy to implement
  * Should work, seems plausible
* Bad ðŸ’© 
  * Will miss every secret & all bonus content
  * There are faster solutions with shortcuts
* Uglyâ˜  
  * Getting Stuck Forever
    * Hole \(cant go back\)
    * Boss \(jumping on boss wont work\)

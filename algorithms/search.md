## What is a Search Algorithm?🧐

A Search Algorithm finds something.

## 🐌 Linear Search vs Binary Search 🚀 

🐌**Linear Search** is an algorithm which looks at each item one by one in unordered list until the item is found.

* Looking for scissors in the junk drawer✂ 
* Matching a single sock to the pair in a pile of laundry 🧦 
* Checking out the old photo album with grandma 👵 

🚀**Binary Search** is an algorithm which continually splits a ordered list in half until the item is found. 

* Finding a specific page number in a book 📖 
  * A person would look like so to find a specific page number
  * 500, 600, 580, 581, 582
  * **Not** like this
  * 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11...582
* Searching for an old holiday photo in a phone🎄
  * Search by year
  * Search by month
  * Search by day

```text
Array:
[1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14,15,16,17,18,19,20]

Goal:
Find the number 14

Linear Search:
1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11,12,13,14

Binary Search:
10,15,14
```

## 🌧BFS: Breadth First Search & DFS: Depth First Search🌩 

🌧**BFS**: Breadth First Search algorithm _**Flows**_ in every direction evenly.

🌩**DFS**: Depth First Search algorithm _**Strikes**_ each direction one by one.

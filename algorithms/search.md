## 🐢 Linear Search vs Binary Search 🚀 

🐢**Linear Search** is an algorithm which looks at each item one by one in unordered list until the item is found.

✂Looking for scissors in the junk drawer✂ 

* Matching a single sock to the pair in a pile of laundry 🧦 
* Checking out the old photo album with grandma 👵 

🚀**Binary Search** is an algorithm which continually splits a ordered list in half until the item is found. 

* 📖Finding a specific page number in a book 📖 
  * A person would look this to find the page number
  * 500, 600, 580, 581, 582
  * Not like this
  * 1,2,3,4,5,6,7,8,9,10,11...582
* 🎅Searching for an old holiday photo in a phone🎄
  * Search by year
  * Search by month
  * Search by day

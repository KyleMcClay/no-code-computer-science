# Network \(Graph\)

## What is a Network \(Graph\) 🎆 

A **Network** is a collection of connected nodes. nodes = elements

## Earth 🌎 🌍 🌏 

Viewing earth from the international space station, there is clusters of light in a sea of darkness. These pockets of light are highly connected **Networks** of people and things people make.   

## Social Network 🌐 

A **Social Network** is groups of people connected together.

Kyle's Facebook Friend Profile: 🌐

* Family Network:
  * ❤Wife, Kids, parents, grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, inlaws❤
* Friends Network:
  * childhood friends🍼, work friends👷♀, hobbie friends🏀🎮
* Dank Meme & Programming Network: 💯 
  * 😜weirdos🤪more weirdos🤥 

I'm personally connected to all these people above in a **Network**. All of the people im connected to are also connected to their own people. and all of those people are... etc, etc, etc... 

## I Need a Map, A Map of the Internet! 🧠

**Networks** are used to represent more complicated relationships and normally used when other data structures simply will not work.

## Types of Networks 🌬 🌪 

**Directed Networks**: Connections between nodes flow in a specific direction 

* Water always flows in one direction from a higher point to a lower point 
  * 🏞 Water Tower -&gt; Homes -&gt; Sewer 🏞 
* Twitters following/follower system
  * I follow the @PresidentOfTheUnitedStates 🚶 
  * The President Of The United States does **Not** follow me 🚫 

**Undirected Networks**: Connections between nodes flow in both directions

* Facebooks friend system
  * I send a friend request to uncle Jim Bob and he accepts 👯♂ 

## Linked List vs Tree vs Network🍎 🌲 🌎 

**Linked List** and **Trees** can be represented as simple **Networks**. The following example explains the differences between the 3 as different types of networks.

**Example:**

* 7 Nodes = A, B, C, D, E, F, G ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ 

**Linked Lists:** a simple directed network where each node flows to the next node. 👉

* ```
  (start) A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> END
  ```

**Trees:** are a directed network where the starting node flows down to multiple nodes 👈👉 

* ```text
             (start)
                A 
                '
        -------------------
       '                   '
       B                   C
       '                   '
   -----------         -----------
  '           '       '           '
  D           E       F           G
  ```

**Networks:** can be used to diagram highly connected systems👈👉👆👇🤙

* ```
  - = 2-way connection
  ' = 2-way connection
  x = 4-way connection
  No starting point 
  No ending point
  ```
* ```
  A  -  B  -  C
  '  x  '  x  '
  D  -  E  -  F
  '  x  '  x  '
  ----- G -----
  ```

The key takeaway is all systems have the same number of **Nodes** but a different number of **Connections.** The **Connections** are what make the data structure a linked list, tree or network**.**

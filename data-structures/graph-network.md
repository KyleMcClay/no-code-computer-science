# Network \(Graph\)

## What is a Network \(Graph\) 🎆 

A Network is a collection of connected nodes. nodes = elements

## Earth 🌎 🌍 🌏 

Viewing earth from the international space station, there is clusters of light in a sea of black. These pockets of light are highly connected **Networks** of people and things people make.   

## Social Network 🌐 

A **Social Network** is a groups of people connected together.

Kyle's Facebook Friend Profile: 🌐

* Family Network:
  * ❤ _Wife, Kids, parents, grandparents, cousins, aunts, uncles, inlaws_❤
* Friends Network:
  * _childhood friends_ 🍼 _, work friends_  👷♀ _, hobbie friends_ 🏀 __🎮 __
* Dank Meme & Programming Network: 💯 
  * 😜 _weirdos_ 🤪 _more weirdos_ 🤥 __

I'm personally connected to all these people above in a Network. All of the people im connected to are also connected to their own people. and all of those people are... etc etc etc 

## I Need a Map, A Map of the Internet! 🧠

Networks are used to represent more complicated relationships and normally used when other data structures simply will not work.

## Types of Networks 🌬 🌪 

**Directed Networks**: connections between nodes flow in a specific direction 

* Water always flows in one direction from a higher point to a lower point 
  * 🏞 _Water Tower -&gt; Homes -&gt; Sewer_ 🏞 
* Twitters following/follower system
  * _I follow the @PresidentOfTheUnitedStates_ 👉 __
  * _The President Of The United States does Not follow me_ 🚫 

**Undirected Networks**: connections between nodes flow in both directions

* Facebooks friend system
  * _I send a friend request to uncle Jim Bob and he accepts_ 👯♂ 

## Linked List vs Tree vs Network🍎 🌲 🌎 

Linked list and Trees can be represented as simple networks. The following example explains the differences between the 3 as different types of networks.

**Example:**

* _7 Nodes = A, B, C, D, E, F, G_ ✴ __✴ __✴ __✴ __✴ __✴ __✴ __✴ __

**Linked Lists:** a simple directed network where each node flows to the next node. 👉

* ```
  (start) A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> END
  ```

**Trees:** are a directed network where the starting node flows down to multiple nodes 👈👉 

* ```text
             (start)
                A 
                '
        -------------------
       '                   '
       B                   C
       '                   '
   -----------         -----------
  '           '       '           '
  D           E       F           G
  ```

**Networks:** can be used to diagram highly connected systems👈👉👆👇🤙

* ```
  - = 2-way connection
  ' = 2-way connection
  x = 4-way connection
  No start 
  No end
  ```
* ```
  A  -  B  -  C
  '  x  '  x  '
  D  -  E  -  F
  '  x  '  x  '
  ----- G -----
  ```

The key takeaway is all systems have the same number of **Nodes** but a different number of **Connections.** The **Connections** are what make the data structure a linked list, tree or network**.**

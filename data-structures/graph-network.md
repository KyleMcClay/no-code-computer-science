# Network \(Graph\)

## What is a Network \(Graph\) 🎆 

A Network is a collection of connected nodes.

## Earth 🌎 🌍 🌏 

Viewing earth from the international space station, there is clusters of light in a sea of black. These pockets of light are highly connected **Networks** of people and things people make.   

## Social Network 🌐 

A **Social Network** is a groups of people connected together.

I'm personally connected to all these people above in a Network. All of the people im connected to are also connected to their own people. and all of those people are... etc etc etc 

## I Need a Map, A Map of the Internet! 🧠

Networks are used to represent more complicated relationships and normally used when other data structures simply will not work.

## Types of Networks 🌬 🌪 

**Directed Networks**: connections between nodes flow in a specific direction 

Water always flows in one direction from a higher point to a lower point

Twitters following/follower system

_I follow the @PresidentOfTheUnitedStates_ 👉 __

_The President Of The United States does Not follow me_ 🚫 

**Undirected Networks**: connections between nodes flow in both directions

## Linked List vs Tree vs Network🍎 🌲 🌎 

Linked list and Trees can be represented as simple networks. The following example explains the differences between the three as different types of networks.

7 Nodes = A, B, C, D, E, F, G ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ ✴ 

**Linked Lists:** a simple directed network where each node flows to one other node. 👉

```text
A -> B -> C -> D -> E -> F -> G -> END
```

**Trees:** are a directed network where the starting node flows in one direction to multiple nodes 👈👉 

```text
                             A (starting)
                             '
                    -------------------
                   '                   '
                   B                   C
                   '                   '
              -----------         -----------
             '           '       '           '
             D           E       F           G
```

**Networks:** can be used to diagram highly connected systems👈👉👆👇🤙

```text
<-> 2-way connection
 '  2-way connection
 x  4-way connection

                   A <-> B <-> C
                   '  x  '  x  '
                   D <-> E <-> F
                    \ x  '  x /
                     <-> G <->
```

The key takeaway is all systems have the same number of _**Nodes**_  but a different number of **Connections.**

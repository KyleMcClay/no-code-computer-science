# Dictionary \(Hash Map\) \(Hash Table\)

## What is a Dictionary? üìñ 

A Dictionary is a collection of key value pairs, meaning in order to access the elements \(value\) a corresponding element \(key\) must be known.

## Key -&gt; Value üîê 

Keys act as unique identifiers to their unique values, similar to a physical key that says, "Honda" on it vs a key with a house carved into it. If i wanted to access my house I would only need to find my house key which looks very different from my car key. 

## IRL Hypothetical üõ£ 

A customer goes into local automotive store. for a recently popped tire, not remembering the date when bought, the warranty offered, or if extra coverage was purchased. The customer asks an employee if his ruined tire is covered. The employee has to look up the information associated with the customer. Normally the **Key** provided is name, and phone number, with this key the employee can access the ****account aka **Value** and find relevant information about the tire purchased. 

## Hash??? üö≠ 

What is meant by hash? A **Hash** is a math-magical way to turn your key into a number \(index\). once the hashing is complete for the key the dictionary is basically an array. This number \(index\) is used to access the value \(item\) in the array.

## Array vs Dictionary __ü§î 

**Arrays** are used when the data needs to be ordered by number.

_Recipe for Apple Pie: 1. do this 2. do this 3. do this_

_Finish times of a race: 1st place: 10 mins 2nd place: 11 mins, 3rd place 11.1 mins_ 

**Dictionaries** are used when the data does not need to be ordered by number and instead can be accessed by name. 

_Recipe book: key = 'Apple pie' value = recipe, key = 'meatloaf' value = recipe, key = 'pizza' value = recipe_ 

_Race contestants: key = 'Kyle' value= \[full name, age, weight, race number\] etc_

## Set ü¶Ñ 

A **Set** is a collection of items with no repeated items. Each item in the set is a special & unique unicorn, just like you the reader. The reason sets are apart of the dictionary section is because sets are implemented as dictionary keys without values. 

_Ash Ketchum the pokemon trainer is trying to collect at least one of all the pokemon._

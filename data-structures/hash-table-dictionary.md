## What is a Dictionary?

A Dictionary is a collection of key value pairs, this means in order to access the element \(value\) a corresponding element \(key\) must be known.

## Key -&gt; Value üîê 

Keys act as unique identifiers to their unique values, similar to a key that says Honda on it vs a key with a house carved into it. If i wanted to access my house I would only need to find my house key which looks very different from my other keys. 

## IRL Hypothetical üõ£ 

A customer goes into local automotive store. for a recently popped tire, not remembering the date when bought, the warranty offered, or if extra coverage was purchased. The customer asks an employee if his ruined tire is covered. The employee has to look up the information associated with the customer. Normally the **Key** provided is name, and phone number, with this key the employee can access the ****account aka **Value** and find relevant information about the tire purchased. 

## Hash??? üö≠ 

What is meant by hash? A **Hash** is a math-magical way to turn your key into a number \(index\). once the hashing is complete for the key the dictionary is basically an array. This number \(index\) is used to access the value \(item\) in the array.

## Array vs Dictionary

Arrays are used when the data can be stored with ordered by numbers. Dictionaries are used when the data needs to be stored unordered and by a name.

## Set ü¶Ñ 

A Set is a collection of items with no repeated items. Each item in the set is a special & unique unicorn, just like you the reader. The reason sets are in the dictionary section is because it is implemented as dictionary keys. No values associated with the set of keys.

# Primitive

## What is a Primitive? 🧱 

A **primitive** is a basic building block of data, the smallest lego brick, the simplest type of data.

## Characters & Strings 💬 

A **Character** is a single letter and can also be a single symbol, or a single number.

* '_a'      '1'      '?'_

A **String** is a series of characters connected together.

* _"Hello World!"      "jkh1?/5h51"      "aaaaaaaaa"_

## Number ➕ ➖ 

A **Number** is a unit apart of a mathematical system and subject to rules of addition, multiplication, etc.

**Types of Numbers**: integer, float, fixed, double, real, double precision, int, short, long, byte, etc... are commonly used data types. 

* _Int = Whole Number = 42_ 🔢 
* _Float = Real Number = 3.14_ 🥧 
* _Long = Big Number = 2,147,483,647_ 🐋 

**Why are there so many types?:** Storing numbers with the appropriate amount memory saves the computer from using extra resources.

* Fraction = 1/3 = .3333333 ♾ 

🖥The fraction 1/3 would crash every computer ever built if stored as an infinite number because computers have limited space🖥

## Numbers are Not Equal to Strings or Characters 👨⚖ 

A computer treats different types of data differently. The number 1 is not the same as the Character 1. 

* 🚫_Int "1" Not Equal  Chr "1"_ 🚫 __
* \_\_🚫_Chr "1" Not Equal Int "1"_ 🚫 __
* \_\_🚫_Float "3.14" Not Equal String "3.14"_ 🚫\_\_
* \_\_🚫_String "3.14" Not Equal Float "3.14"_ 🚫 __ 

## Boolean & Binary 🌝 🌚 

A **Boolean** has one of two possible values: True or False.

* ▶ _music player \(play, pause\)_⏸
* 💡_light switch \(on, off\)_💡\_\_
* \_\_🚰_water faucet \(open, closed\)_🚰 __

**Binary** is a number built from two possible values: 1 or 0.

* _1_
* _0_
* _1001001_
* _1111_

🖥 A computer converts all information into 1's and 0's stores/manipulates that data and spits back what you see. 🖥 

## Reference \(Pointer\)👉🏠 

A **Reference** is where a piece of data is in memory

```text
Address =   1   2   3
          +---+---+---+
Data =    | a | b | c |
          +---+---+---+
```

1. _I want the data at address 2_
2. _I use the reference number 2_
3. _I get the data I want 'b'_

A reference can be thought of as a physical address, a bank account number, a bitcoin wallet, or venmo/cashapp/zelle address.   

* Citing original sources in a research paper 📜 
* Paying a friend back for pizza using venmo 🍕 

💸 peer-to-peer mobile payment apps are good examples because you dont know whats in someone elses account but you do know how to request money or send money to that account💸 

## Story Time: Ancient Atomic Theory⚛

The inventor of atomic theory, Democritus, a Greek philosopher  🤔 who lived in 500 B.C. While Democritus was drinking wine, eating bread and philosophising with friends. He imagined continuously cutting an item in half. if he cut his loaf of bread in two he knew the halves would have the same properties as the whole. If he continued cutting forever he hypothesized a limit where his bread was uncuttable, it was as small as it could possible be, indivisible. These uncuttable pieces he called "atomos", the Greek word for indivisible.

> "Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion."  Democritus

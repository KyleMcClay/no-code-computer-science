# Primitive

## What is a Primitive? 🧱 

A **Primitive** is a basic building block of data, the smallest lego brick, the simplest type of data.

## Characters & Strings 💬 

A **Character** is a single letter and can also be a single symbol, or a single number.

* _'a'      '1'      '?'_

A **String** is a series of characters connected together.

* "Hello World!"      "jkh1?/5h51"      "aaaaaaaaa"

## Number ➕ ➖ 

A **Number** is a unit apart of a mathematical system and subject to rules of addition, multiplication, etc.

**Types of Numbers**: integer, float, fixed, double, real, double precision, int, short, long, byte, etc... are commonly used data types. 

* Int = Whole Number = 42 🔢 
* Float = Real Number = 3.14 🥧 
* Long = Big Number = 2,147,483,647 🐋 

**Why are there so many types?:** Storing numbers with the appropriate amount memory saves the computer from using extra resources.

* Fraction = 1/3 = .3333333 ♾ 

🖥The fraction 1/3 would crash every computer ever built if stored as an infinite number because computers have limited space🖥

## Numbers are Not Equal to Strings or Characters 👨⚖ 

A computer treats different types of data differently. The number 1 is not the same as the character 1. 

* 🚫Int "1" Not Equal  Chr "1" 🚫 
* 🚫Chr "1" Not Equal Int "1" 🚫 
* 🚫Float "3.14" Not Equal String "3.14" 🚫
* 🚫String "3.14" Not Equal Float "3.14" 🚫  

## Boolean & Binary 🌝 🌚 

A **Boolean** has one of two possible values: True or False.

* ▶ music player \(play, pause\)⏸
* 💡light switch \(on, off\)💡
* 🚰water faucet \(open, closed\)🚰 

**Binary** is a number built from two possible values: 1 or 0.

* 1
* 0
* 1001001
* 1111

🖥 A computer converts all information into 1's and 0's stores/manipulates that data and spits back what you see. 🖥 

## Reference \(Pointer\)👉🏠 

A **Reference** is where a piece of data is in memory.

```text
Address =   1   2   3
          +---+---+---+
Data =    | a | b | c |
          +---+---+---+
```

1. I want the data at address 2
2. I use the reference number 2
3. I get the data I want 'b'

A **Reference** can be thought of as a physical address, a bank account number, a bitcoin wallet, or venmo/cashapp/zelle address.   

* Citing original sources in a research paper 📜 
* Paying a friend back for pizza using venmo 🍕 

💸 peer-to-peer mobile payment apps are good examples because you dont know whats in someone elses account but you do know how to request money or send money to that account💸 

## Story Time: Ancient Atomic Theory⚛

The inventor of atomic theory, Democritus, a Greek philosopher🤔who lived in 500 B.C. He imagined continuously cutting an item in half. if he cut a rock in two, he knew the halves would have the same properties as the whole. If he continued cutting forever, he hypothesized a limit where his rock was uncuttable. The piece was as small as it could possible be \(indivisible\). These uncuttable pieces he called "atomos", the Greek word for indivisible.

> "Nothing exists except atoms and empty space; everything else is opinion."  Democritus

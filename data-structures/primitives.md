# Primitive

## What is a Primitive?

A primitive is a basic building block of data, the smallest lego brick, the simplest type of data.

## Character & String

A **Character** is a single letter and can also be a single symbol, or a single number.

_'a'      '1'      '?'_

A **String** is a series of characters connected together.

_"Hello World!"      "jkh1?/5h51"      "aaaaaaaaa"_

## Number

A **Number** is a unit apart of a mathematical system and subject to rules of addition, multiplication, etc.

**Types of Numbers**: integer, float, fixed, double, real, double precision, int, short, long, byte, etc... common meanings with examples: int = whole number = 42, float = real number = 3.14, long = a big number = 2,147,483,647

**Why are there so many?** computers have to store numbers in memory which causes problems in the real world. take the fraction 1/3 = .333 where 3 repeats forever, so this fraction would crash every computer ever built because there is an infinite amount of numbers, which means infinite amount of memory used.

**Note**: The **Character** '1' or a **String** of numbers "102" is not the same as the N**umber** 1 or N**umber** 102.

## Boolean & Binary

A **Boolean** has one of two possible values: True or False.

Common examples IRL:

ðŸ’¡_light switch \(on, off\)_ ðŸ’¡\_\_

ðŸš°_water faucet \(open, closed\)_ðŸš° __

**Binary** is a number built from two possible values: 1 or 0.

_1     0      1010101     100_1

ðŸ–¥ A computer converts all information into 1's and 0's stores/manipulates that data and spits back what you see. ðŸ–¥ 

## Reference \(Pointer\)

A **Reference** is where a specific type of data is in memory

A reference can be thought of as a physical address, an bank account number, bitcoin wallet, or a venmo/cashapp/zelle address.   

ðŸ’¸ Modern day peer-to-peer mobile payment apps are good example because you dont know whats in someone elses account but you do know how to request money or send money to accountðŸ’¸ 

## Story Time: Ancient Atomic Theory

The inventor of atomic theory, Democritus, a Greek philosopher  ðŸ¤” who lived in 500 B.C. While Democritus was drinking wine, eating bread and philosophising with friends. He imagined continuously cutting an item in half. if he cut his loaf of bread in two he knew the halves would have the same properties as the whole. If he continued cutting forever he hypothesized a limit where his bread was uncuttable, it was as small as it could possible be, indivisible. These uncuttable pieces he called "atomos"âš›, the Greek word for indivisible.
